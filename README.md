# Smart-Bin

DESCRIPTION

In this project i make a automatic dustbin which open itself when you near it and it work and open for 2second and clsoe itself and also restartthe process after 5second.By using Servo motor and ultrasonic sensor to make it precise.

THE COMPONENTS:

1.Ultrasonic sensor 
2.Servo motor 
3.Arduino Uno R3 
4.breadboard 
5.jumper wires 
6.5v battery

WORKING

An ultrasonic sensor detects an object near the dustbin. The Arduino processes the distance data and activates a servo motor to open the lid when an object is within range. After a short delay, the lid closes automatically. The system runs on a rechargeable lithium battery, ensuring touchless and efficient operation.
